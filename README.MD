# Bitcoin Rust SDK for ICP  

## Problem  

Bitcoin developers, as well as Internet Computer (ICP) developers working with Bitcoin, lack a lightweight, modular Rust SDK to interact with ICP's native Bitcoin capabilities. Existing tools often assume a JavaScript/Node.js environment or rely on large, monolithic libraries like `bitcoin-rs`. Additionally, there is limited documentation and examples for lower-level primitives such as transaction crafting and signing (especially multisig), particularly in the context of ICP canisters.  

## Solution  

This project aims to build a minimal, well-documented Rust SDK for Bitcoin on ICP, with no external dependencies. The SDK is tailored for:  

- **ICP Canisters**: Rust-based modules for seamless integration.  
- **Wallet/Backend Developers**: Fine-grained control over Bitcoin transactions.  
- **Educators and Hackers**: A learning tool for understanding Bitcoin internals.  

### Key Features  

- üîç **UTXO Parsing**: Efficient handling of unspent transaction outputs.  
- üîê **P2PKH + P2P2PKH Transaction Crafting**: Create standard  transactions.  
- üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë **Multisig Support**: Build, sign, and verify M-of-N multisig transactions.  
- üîó **ICP Bitcoin API Integration**: Interfaces for interacting with ICP's native Bitcoin capabilities.  
- üì¶ **No External Bitcoin Libraries**: Built entirely with native Rust cryptographic primitives.  
- üìò **Comprehensive Documentation**: Includes examples, guides, and Wasm-ready modules.  

## Architecture  

The SDK is designed to be modular, lightweight, and extensible.  

1. **Core Modules**:  
    - **UTXO Parser**: Extract and manage UTXO data.  
    - **Transaction Builder**: Create P2PKH, P2WPKH,  transactions.  
    - **Signer**: Sign transactions using private keys.  
    - **Verifier**: Verify transaction signatures and multisig setups.  

2. **ICP Integration**:  
    - Wrappers for ICP's Bitcoin API, enabling seamless interaction with block headers, transaction verification, and more.  

3. **Developer Tools**:  
    - CLI playground for testing and debugging.  
    - Rust canister integration examples for real-world use cases.  

4. **Documentation and Examples**:  
    - Step-by-step guides for crafting Bitcoin transactions.  
    - Tutorials for integrating the SDK into ICP canisters.  

## Outcomes  

- **Open-Source SDK**: Licensed under MIT/Apache for maximum adoption.  
- **Rust Crate**: A lightweight, easy-to-use library for Bitcoin primitives on ICP.  
- **Integrated Example**: A canister that constructs and verifies a multisig Bitcoin transaction.  
- **Developer Adoption**: Tutorials and guides to help developers get started quickly.  

## Future Enhancements  

- **Taproot + Schnorr Support**: Add advanced Bitcoin primitives as ICP adopts them.  
- **WebAssembly Modules**: Enable cross-language usage of the SDK.  
- **Web Playground**: Build a web-based UI for testing and learning, hosted on ICP.  

This SDK is not just a tool but a gateway for Rust and ICP developers to explore Bitcoin-level logic, enabling native Bitcoin integrations, DeFi applications, and more.
